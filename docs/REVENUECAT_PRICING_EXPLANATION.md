# 💰 RevenueCat Pricing - How It Works

## ⚠️ Important: You Can't Set Pricing in RevenueCat!

**This is normal!** RevenueCat doesn't control pricing - the app stores do.

---

## 🔍 How Pricing Actually Works

### RevenueCat's Role:
- ✅ Manages which products exist (by ID)
- ✅ Handles subscription logic
- ✅ Grants entitlements
- ❌ **Does NOT set prices**

### App Stores' Role:
- ✅ Set the actual prices
- ✅ Handle payments
- ✅ Manage subscriptions
- ✅ Control pricing by country

---

## 📋 What You Should Do in RevenueCat

### For Products, Just Set:
1. **Identifier** (Product ID): `monthly`, `yearly`, `lifetime`
2. **Type**: Subscription or Non-consumable
3. **That's it!** No pricing needed here

### RevenueCat Product Setup:
```
Product: monthly
  - Identifier: monthly
  - Type: Auto-renewable Subscription
  - (No price field - that's OK!)
```

---

## 💵 Where Pricing is Actually Set

### Later, in App Store Connect / Google Play Console:

**App Store Connect:**
- Go to your app → Features → In-App Purchases
- Create subscription product
- **Set price here:** CA$6.99/month (Canada)
- Product ID must match: `monthly_pro`

**Google Play Console:**
- Go to Monetize → Subscriptions
- Create subscription
- **Set price here:** CA$6.99/month (Canada)
- Product ID must match: `monthly_pro`

---

## 🎯 For Now (Test Store)

### What You Need to Do:

1. **Just create the products with IDs:**
   - `monthly_pro`
   - `yearly_pro`

2. **Don't worry about pricing yet!**
   - RevenueCat will work without prices
   - Prices come from stores when you connect them
   - For testing, you can use test prices later

---

## ✅ What Your RevenueCat Products Should Look Like

### Product 1: Monthly
```
Identifier: monthly
Type: Subscription (Auto-renewable)
Store Product ID: monthly
Price: (Leave empty or N/A - that's OK!)
```

### Product 2: Yearly
```
Identifier: yearly
Type: Subscription (Auto-renewable)
Store Product ID: yearly
Price: (Leave empty - that's OK!)
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Without Prices

**You can still:**
- ✅ Create products in RevenueCat
- ✅ Create entitlements
- ✅ Create offerings
- ✅ Test the flow in your app
- ✅ See packages in paywall

**Pricing will show:**
- As "N/A" or "$0.00" in test mode (that's fine!)
- Or when you connect to stores with real products

---

## 🔄 The Flow

### Current (Test Store):
1. Create products in RevenueCat (no pricing) ✅
2. Set up entitlement and offering ✅
3. Test in app (prices may show as N/A - that's OK!) ✅

### Later (Production):
1. Create products in App Store Connect with prices (CA$6.99 / CA$49.99 in Canada)
2. Create products in Google Play Console with matching regional prices
3. Connect stores to RevenueCat
4. RevenueCat will automatically get prices from stores
5. Prices will show correctly in your app
